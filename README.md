# üöÄ Full DevOps Pipeline: Node.js App Deployment on AWS EKS

This project demonstrates a complete DevOps workflow for a Node.js application using GitHub Actions, AWS services, Docker, security scanners, and Slack notifications.

---

## üìå Objective

Build an automated CI/CD pipeline that performs the following:

- Lint, test, and analyze code quality
- Perform security scans on source and Docker image
- Build Docker image and push to AWS ECR
- Provision EKS cluster using Terraform
- Deploy the containerized app to EKS
- Send Slack notifications for deployment status

---

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] GitHub Actions pipeline is triggered on push to `main`
- [ ] EC2 instance is used as GitHub self-hosted runner
- [ ] Dockerfile builds the Node.js app
- [ ] Trivy scans source and Docker image for vulnerabilities
- [ ] SonarQube performs static code analysis
- [ ] Docker image is pushed to AWS ECR
- [ ] Terraform provisions an EKS cluster and node group
- [ ] Kubernetes deployment manifests are applied to EKS
- [ ] Checkov scans Terraform code
- [ ] Mattermost receives success/failure notifications
